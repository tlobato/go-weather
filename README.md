# go-weather

A simple CLI app built with Go that gets the weather from https://weatherapi.com, its default location is Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, but accepts an optional argument that can be any city.

I assigned the command "go-calc" to it's binary and now I use it in my daily life to check the weather of the day from the terminal.

It uses https://github.com/fatih/color package to give the forecast in red if the chance of rain at that hour is more than 40%
